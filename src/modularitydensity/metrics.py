    Notes
    -----
    Modularity density in [1] is given as
    .. math::
       Q = \sum_{c \in C}\Bigg\{\frac{\sum_{i,j \in c}T_{ij}}{n_c}  - \sum_{c^{\prime} \in C-c}\Bigg( \frac{\sum_{{i \in c,}{j \in c^{\prime}}}T_{ij}}{\sqrt{n_c n_{c^{\prime}}}}\Bigg)\Bigg\}

       where:

       - each cluster ${c \in C}$ is represented by an indicator vector ${\vec{v}_c = [v{_{c_i}}] \in {\R}^{|V|} : v{_{c_i}}= 1}$ if ${i \in c}$, else $0$

       - \hat{n}_c = \frac{\vec{v}_c}{|\vec{v}_c|}
